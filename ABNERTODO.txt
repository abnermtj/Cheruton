Movement and Collisions
        Flow, cosistency, control, jump and movement have to be perfect
        Input buffering
        Movement cancelling
        Finite state machine for character state
        jump improvements
                - delay window before you not allowed to jump after ledge 
                - jump corner correction instead of a hardbump
                - dashing against a corner will plop you up
